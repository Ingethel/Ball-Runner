# Ball-Runner

A platform/runner mini game with simplistic graphics.

Mostly a case study for automatic tile-map generation. 
The environment is generated randomly and infinitely as long as the player survives and progresses. 
There are collectibles along the way for the user, which can be gathered to increase his score. 
However there are some that will hinder his movement abilities, so collect with caution.

The game can be freely downloaded on android devices from Google Play.
